# The-Multi-Client-Mayhem-Advanced-Challenge-
This project implements a robust real-time client-server file transfer system that supports multiple clients concurrently uploading and downloading files. Each client's file is sent to the server, split into fixed-size chunks, and then transmitted back with simulated network errors such as packet drops and corruption.
